# Document-Summarization-and-Meeting-Status-Tracking
This repository contains a collection of approaches and implementations for efficiently summarizing documents and tracking meeting statuses. The methods utilize advanced techniques such as chunking documents, iterative summarization, and context preservation to ensure enriched and comprehensive updates. 

# Key Features
- Chunking and Summarization: Documents are internally divided into smaller sections, allowing for iterative summarization that maintains the context of previous chunks.
- JSON Output: Summaries are extracted in a structured JSON format, capturing all important document fields for easy integration and analysis.
- Contextual Awareness: Each summary process preserves context across chunks to provide coherent and meaningful updates.
- Enhanced Meeting Status Tracking: Approaches for merging current meeting transcripts with previous project reports to maintain up-to-date project statuses.

# Usage
The repository includes code samples and detailed reports on the methodologies employed. Users can leverage these approaches to improve their document management and meeting tracking processes.
